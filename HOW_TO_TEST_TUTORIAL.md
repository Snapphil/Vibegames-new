# 🧪 How to Test the iOS Tutorial

## ✅ Easy Method - Use the Floating Button!

I've added a **floating red reset button** to your app!

### Steps:
1. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Look for the red button** in the bottom-right corner:
   ```
   🔄 Reset Tutorial
   ```

3. **Tap the button**
   - You'll see an alert: "Onboarding reset!"
   - The button will disappear

4. **Close and reopen the app**
   - On iOS Simulator: Press `Cmd+Shift+H` twice, swipe up to close
   - Or just stop and restart with `npm start`

5. **Watch the beautiful iOS tutorial appear!** 🎉

## 🔧 Alternative Method - Console Commands

If you prefer manual control, use these in your terminal:

```javascript
// In your app's console:
await OnboardingServiceInstance.resetOnboarding()
// Then reload app
```

## 📱 What You'll See

After reset and reload:
```
LOG  🔄 Resetting onboarding...
LOG  🗑️ Removed from AsyncStorage
LOG  🗑️ Reset in Firestore
LOG  ✅ Onboarding reset complete!
LOG  🎓 Checking onboarding status...
LOG  📱 AsyncStorage onboarding status: null
LOG  🎯 Returning FALSE - onboarding will be shown
LOG  🎓 First-time user detected!
LOG  🎓 Displaying onboarding overlay
```

Then you'll see the iOS-style tutorial with:
- ✅ Blur effect backgrounds
- ✅ Bouncing blue arrows
- ✅ Pulsing spotlights
- ✅ Gradient buttons
- ✅ Progress dots
- ✅ Smooth animations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Button Not Visible?
- Check bottom-right corner
- It's a red floating button
- Only shows once per app session

### Tutorial Still Not Showing?
1. Check console logs for:
   ```
   🎓 First-time user detected!
   ```
2. If you see "completed: true", the reset didn't work
3. Try manually clearing:
   - Delete app and reinstall
   - Or clear app data in settings

### Want to Remove the Reset Button?
After testing, edit `app/index.tsx` and remove:
```typescript
// Line 174-184: Remove this code
const [showResetButton, setShowResetButton] = React.useState(true);
// ... and the floating button code (lines 306-330)
```

## ✨ Expected Experience

The new iOS tutorial should feel like:
- Apple's own app tutorials
- Smooth and polished
- Non-intrusive
- Helpful and clear
- Beautiful animations

Enjoy testing! 🎉
